# Getting Started

## No-install quickstart

Go to the m2c2kit [playground](/playground) to run assessments, examine code, and create new assessments in your web browser.

## Local install

Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >=18). The CLI can quickly scaffold a demo app and serve it on your local machine:

```
npm install -g @m2c2kit/cli
m2 new myapp
cd myapp
npm run serve
```

You can now go to http://localhost:3000 to view the demo app.
