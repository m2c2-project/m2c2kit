# Getting Started

TODO: Getting started...

## No-install quickstart

Go to the m2c2kit [playground](https://m2c2kit.z13.web.core.windows.net/) to take assessments, view assessment source code (TypeScript), and modify assessments (or create new ones) in your web browser.

## Local install

Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >=16). The CLI can quickly scaffold a demo app and serve it on your local machine.

```
npm install -g @m2c2kit/cli
m2 new myapp
cd myapp
npm run serve
```

You can now go to http://localhost:3000 to view the demo app.
