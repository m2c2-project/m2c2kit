# Assessment packages

Existing assessments are m2c2kit assessments that have been programmed by others, such as [these](../../category/examples/). Assessments authored by the m2c2 project are distributed in the form of packages on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the world's largest software registry.

The first step in deploying existing assessments is to decide what assessments you want to use. Specifically, for each assessment, you need its **package name** and **version**.

## Assessment package name

Each assessment has a unique package name. Our assessment package names take the format of `@m2c2kit/assessment-<name of the assessment>`. 

| Assessment      | Package name                            |
| :---------------| :-------------------------------------- |
| Symbol Search   | `@m2c2kit/assessment-symbol-search`     |
| Grid Memory     | `@m2c2kit/assessment-grid-memory`       |
| Color Shapes    | `@m2c2kit/assessment-color-shapes`      |
| Color Dots      | `@m2c2kit/assessment-color-dots`        |

To list the m2c2kit assessments and versions available on NPM, make sure you have [installed](../what-is-deployment#installing-the-command-line-interface-cli) the m2c2kit CLI. Then:

```
m2 static-site --list
```

You will see output similar to this:

```

```

## Assessment versions

Assessments on NPM are immutable: once a package is published with a name and version, it cannot be changed. Thus, NPM provides excellent reproducibility. Even if an assessment is updated at a later date, it must be given a new version. The prior version will remain available.

Unless you have a special reason, it's best to use the latest version of a package.
