# Custom parameters

## `parameters` will change the assessment defaults

The `parameters` property allows you to change the default assessment parameters to fit your needs. 

Below, Symbol Search has been configured to have 4 trials and not show the quit button.

```js
{
  name: "@m2c2kit/assessment-symbol-search",
  versions: ">=0.8.19",
  parameters: {
    number_of_trials: 4,
    show_quit_button: false
  }
}
```

For assessments authored by the m2c2 team, all assessment parameters (also referred to as **game parameters**) are documented in our [schema reference](../../schemas/what-is-schema).

:::warning

You can change a parameter to any value, but not all values will be scientifically valid for your use case.

Check with the research literature or the m2c2 team for recommended values.
