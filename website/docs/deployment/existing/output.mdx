# Output files

## `outDir` determines where the static website files go

Set the `outDir` property to the directory where the static site should be created. This directory will hold all the HTML, JavaScript, and other files needed to run the assessments in the participant's browser.

When you created a config file with the CLI and `--init` option, the `outDir` is set to `./dist`. You can leave it unchanged, because it is a common convention to put a static website's production-ready files there for "distribution."
