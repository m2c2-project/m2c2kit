# Static site generation

In the context of a static website, hosting refers to storing and serving the files that make up the static site. But before the static site can be hosted, its files must be generated.


## Generating the static site with the CLI

The m2c2kit CLI will create the static site from the configuration file, which by default was named `site-config.mjs`. To generate the site:

```
m2 static-site --config=site-config.mjs
```

The CLI will display information about assessment packages that were downloaded and files that were created

The many lines of information output by the static site generation can be ignored; they are there for debugging if things go wrong!

## Testing the static site

To test that the static site is working, you must serve these files locally on your computer. You cannot directly open them with your browser.

A convenient way to serve these files is the [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package. To install this:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

To use this package to test the static site:

- Change to the directory where the static site was generated, e.g., `cd dist`
- Run the server: `http-server`
- Open your browser at the address where `http-server` is serving. By default it will be `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

Once you open your browser to the appropriate location, you will see... **nothing**!
