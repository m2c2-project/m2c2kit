# Your own server

If you operate your own server capable of serving files, you can host the static website by copying the files from the `outDir` to the appropriate location on the server.

For example, if you are running [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), copy the files to `/var/www/html/`.

:::tip

If you visit the site and it is blank, remember that you must [specify the assessment](./site-usage#specifying-the-assessment)!
