# Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is a platform for deploying web apps and static web sites. Their free tier plan is convenient for testing.

The Netlify CLI can easily deploy a static website.

## Installing the Netlify CLI

It is convenient if the CLI is installed globally:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

## Deploying the static website

If not there already, change to the directory with the m2c2kit static site, e.g.:

```
cd dist
```

Login:

```
netlify login
```

Begin the deployment (you will be asked to authenticate):

```
netlify deploy --prod
```

If successful, the CLI will give you a URL where the static site is hosted.

:::tip

If you visit the site and it is blank, remember that you must [specify the assessment](./site-usage#specifying-the-assessment)!
