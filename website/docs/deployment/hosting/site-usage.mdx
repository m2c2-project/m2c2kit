# Using the static site

To use the static website in your research, you will direct participants to the assessment you want them to take.

## Specifying the assessment

Directly visiting the static site main web page shows nothing because the entry web page is expecting a URL parameter to tell it what assessment to run. Remember, a m2c2kit static site can host many assessments and many versions of those assessments.

<details>
  <summary>üåê What is a URL parameter?</summary>

  A [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL) specifies the location of a resource on the internet.

  URL parameters are additional information passed to the webpage. They are appended to the end of the URL, after a `?`. Multiple parameters can be used by separating them with `&`.
  
  For example, to set parameters called `name` and `school`, the URL would be: `http://www.example.com?name=m2c2kit&school=PennState`

  What if you want to set a parameter to a value that includes spaces, or even a `&` or `=` character? To do that, you must [encode](https://www.urlencoder.org/) the value (sometimes called URL-encoding, URI-encoding, or [percent encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)).

  For example, to set the parameter `school` to `franklin & marshall`, we would pass in the URL-encoded value, which is `franklin%20%26%20marshall`. The URL would be `http://www.example.com?name=m2c2kit&school=franklin%20%26%20marshall`
</details>

To run a particular assessment, set the URL parameter called `assessment` to the package name and version of an assessment you specified in the site configuration.

For example, consider a configuration file that looked like this:

```
assessments: [
  {
    name: "@m2c2kit/assessment-symbol-search",
    versions: ">=0.8.19",
  },
  {
    name: "@m2c2kit/assessment-grid-memory",
    versions: ">=0.8.19"
  }
]
```

To run version 0.8.19 of Symbol Search, the browser address would be:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html?assessment=@m2c2kit/assessment-symbol-search@0.8.19`

To run version 0.8.19 of Grid Memory, the browser address would be:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html?assessment=@m2c2kit/assessment-grid-memory@0.8.19`

Still confused? If you get a blank page, open the developer console. There will be some helpful messages about what assessments are in the static site and how to run them.

## Use cases

A URL with the appropriate `assessment` parameter is how you will direct participants to specific assessments, such as:

- Participants complete a survey in Qualtrics or RedCap, and then you direct them to a m2c2kit assessment on the static site.
- In an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach, you send participants text messages at carefully chosen times. The messages contain a URL to a m2c2kit assessment on the static site.

## Individual-level parameter customization

In the site configuration, the `parameters` property allowed customization of assessment parameters. However, you may want parameters customizations specific to a group of participants or a single participant.

If assessment parameters are added to the URL, it will override the parameters that were set in the site configuration.

Imagine we had two groups of participants. Group A has an abbreviated protocol (only 6 trials). Group B has the full protocol (12 trials). You could send the following URLs:

- Group A receives `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html?assessment=@m2c2kit/assessment-symbol-search@0.8.19&number_of_trials=6`
- Group B receives `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html?assessment=@m2c2kit/assessment-symbol-search@0.8.19&number_of_trials=12`

(of course, in a real study, the static site would not be running on your local machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, but you get the idea!)
