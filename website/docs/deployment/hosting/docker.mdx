# Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a way to build and ship portable containers for running applications.

Containers are typically used in more advanced deployment scenarios, in which coordination with other web services is needed.

## Generate the site and a Dockerfile

The m2c2kit CLI can create a simple Dockerfile to demonstrate how the static site can be containerized. To do this, use the `--dockerfile` option:

```
m2 static-site --config=site-config.mjs --dockerfile
```

This will create a Dockerfile that can serve the static site using [NGINX](https://nginx.org/), a popular open-source web server.

## Run the image as a container

To build an image from the Dockerfile and serve the site using NGINX on local port 8080, mapping to port 80 in the container:

```
docker build -t m2c2kit-static-site .
docker run -p 8080:80 m2c2kit-static-site
```

:::tip

If you visit the site and it is blank, remember that you must [specify the assessment](./site-usage#specifying-the-assessment)!
