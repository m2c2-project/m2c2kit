# What is a schema?

A schema describes the structure of data. It is a set of rules that defines what data are required, what data are optional, and what the data types are. A schema is used to validate data and to inform data consumers how they can use the data.

m2c2kit uses a subset of [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to describe:

- The configurable game parameters that customize how the assessment is administered.
- The data that are generated by each trial in the assessment.

Each assessment has unique schema for its game parameters and trial data.

Refer to the [section on Schemas](../tutorials/fundamentals/user-data/schemas.mdx) in the tutorial for how to use schemas in your assessment.
