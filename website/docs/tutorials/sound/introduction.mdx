# Introduction

Sounds can be useful in cognitive assessments in two ways:

- Playing sounds as stimuli
- Recording sounds as participant data

In m2c2kit, the `SoundPlayer` node plays audio files, and the `SoundRecorder` node records audio data.

:::warning

Sound in m2c2kit is experimental, and the API may change in the future.
