# Events

One way of thinking of user interaction is that the user is sending **events** to the nodes. For example, when the user clicks on a button, the button receives a `TapDown` event. The button can then respond to the event by executing code. The code passed into the `onTapDown()` method is called an [event handler](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)#Event_handler>) because it handles the `TapDown` event.

This event handler prints a message to the console when the button is tapped:

```js
myButton.onTapDown(() => {
    console.log("TapDown event!");
});
```

  <summary>Event handlers, callback functions, and <code>() =></code></summary>
  <p>To be precise, the event handler is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callback function</a>. You may not be familiar with the <b>arrow function</b> syntax, which looks like <code>() => &#123; ... &#125;</code> and might seem strange. Don't worry too much about it -- just put the code you want to execute inside the curly braces. You can read more about arrow functions <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">here</a>.</p>

Alternatively, instead of arrow function syntax, you could provide a function. This code is equivalent to the above:
<pre>
  <code className="language-js">{`function logTheEvent() {
  console.log("TapDown event!");
}
 
myButton.onTapDown(logTheEvent);`}
  </code>
</pre>
  <p>Arrows function are a useful shortcut when you don't want to define a separate function to execute some code.</p>

There are several types of events that can be sent to nodes:

- `TapDown` - occurs when the user begins a touch or click within the bounds of the node.
- `TapUp` - occurs when the user releases a touch or click within the bounds of the node.
- `TapLeave` - occurs when the user holds a touch or click on the node, but moves outside the bounds of the node.
- `TapUpAny` - occurs when the user releases a touch or click within _or_ outside the bounds of the node.
- `PointerDown` - occurs when the user begins a touch or click within the bounds of the node. Same as `TapDown`.
- `PointerUp` - occurs when the user releases a touch or click within the bounds of the node, but the touch or click _did not_ have to begin within the bounds of the node.
- `PointerMove` - occurs when the user moves the mouse or touch within the bounds of the node.

The variety of tap and pointer events may seem confusing, and the difference between a tap and a pointer may also be hard to understand. In most cases, you'll just need the `TapDown` and `TapUp` events. The other events are useful for more advanced scenarios.
