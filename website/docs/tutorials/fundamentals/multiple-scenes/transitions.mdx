# Transitions

Animate the move from one scene to another.

When the `presentScene()` method is called, it immediately presents the new scene. This may be exactly what you want: show a fixation cross on one scene, and immediately switch to a scene with a stimulus. However, sometimes you want to animate the transition from one scene to another, perhaps simply for a more contemporary application experience, or to provide the user with a sense of navigation and movement.

The `presentScene()` method takes an optional second argument that specifies the transition to use. It can be:

- `Transition.none()` - the default, which is the same as not specifying a transition.
- `Transition.slide()` - slides the new scene in from another direction.

## Options for the slide transition

`Transition.slide()` takes an object with options for the transition. The options are:

- `direction` - the direction the new scene slides towards. It can be `TransitionDirection.Left`, `TransitionDirection.Right`, `TransitionDirection.Up`, or `TransitionDirection.Down`. This is required.
- `duration` - how long it takes for the transition to complete, in milliseconds. This is required.
- `easing` - the easing function to use. This is optional. We'll learn about this [later](./easings.mdx).

Below, the transition from the first to the second screen is an animation that slides in the new screen from right to left, which is `direction: TransitionDirection.Left`. The animation takes 750 milliseconds to occur.

```js
game.presentScene(
    sceneTwo,
    Transition.slide({ direction: TransitionDirection.Left, duration: 750 })
);
```

The transition from the second to the first scene slides from left to right, which is `direction: TransitionDirection.Right`. The animation takes 250 milliseconds.

```js
game.presentScene(
    sceneOne,
    Transition.slide({ direction: TransitionDirection.Right, duration: 250 })
);
```

import template from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/m2c2kit-index-html-templates/basic-template.html';

export const code = `const sceneOne = new Scene({ backgroundColor: WebColors.WhiteSmoke });
game.addScene(sceneOne);
const forwardButton = new Button({
    text: "Forward!",
    fontSize: 14,
    backgroundColor: WebColors.RoyalBlue,
    size: { width: 160, height: 50 },
    position: { x: 100, y: 200 },
    isUserInteractionEnabled: true
});
sceneOne.addChild(forwardButton);
 
forwardButton.onTapDown(() => {
    game.presentScene(sceneTwo,
    Transition.slide({ direction: TransitionDirection.Left, duration: 750 }));
});
 
const sceneTwo = new Scene({ backgroundColor: WebColors.LightPink });
game.addScene(sceneTwo);
const backButton = new Button({
    text: "Run away, run away!",
    fontSize: 14,
    backgroundColor: WebColors.DarkRed,
    size: { width: 160, height: 50 },
    position: { x: 100, y: 200 },
    isUserInteractionEnabled: true
});
sceneTwo.addChild(backButton);
 
backButton.onTapDown(() => {
    game.presentScene(sceneOne,
    Transition.slide({ direction: TransitionDirection.Right, duration: 250 }));
});
`;
