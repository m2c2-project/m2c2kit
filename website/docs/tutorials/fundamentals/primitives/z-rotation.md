# Rotation

Adjust a node's `zRotation` to rotate it about its axis.

A node's `zRotation` property determines its rotation. The unit of measurement is [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian) instead of degrees. There are 2π radians in a circle, or 360°. A positive rotation is counterclockwise, and a negative rotation is clockwise. The rotation affects any children, if present. For example, if you rotate a `Scene`, all of its children will also be rotated.

:::tip

In JavaScript, if you don't want to type `3.14159...` for π, you can use `Math.PI`.

:::

Below, the letter A has its `zRotation` is set to `π/2`, which is ¼ of a full circle or 90°. The letter A is rotated counterclockwise.
