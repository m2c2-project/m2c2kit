# Introduction

**m2c2kit** is a library for creating cross-platform cognitive assessments. It is produced by the Ambulatory Methods for Measuring Cognitive Change research project (Award #U2CAG060408), sponsored by the [National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/).

m2c2kit is fully open-source with a [permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license) [license](https://github.com/m2c2-project/m2c2kit/blob/main/LICENSE) (MIT) to promote its use in research and commercial applications.

m2c2kit is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and leverages Google's [canvaskit-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvaskit-wasm) Skia-based graphics engine to present cognitive assessments using HTML5 and JavaScript. Participants can take these assessments with a mobile or desktop browser, or the assessments can be programmed into native mobile apps using a webview. m2c2kit borrows some patterns, approaches, and naming conventions from Apple's [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit) framework, but it is not a port of SpriteKit.
