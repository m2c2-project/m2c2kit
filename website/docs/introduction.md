# Introduction

m2c2kit is a library for creating cross-platform cognitive assessments. It is produced by the Ambulatory Methods for Measuring Cognitive Change research project (Award #U2CAG060408), sponsored by the [National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/).

m2c2kit is written in Typescript and leverages Google's [canvaskit-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvaskit-wasm) Skia-based graphics engine to present cognitive assessments using HTML5 and JavaScript. Users can take these assessments with a mobile or desktop browser, or the assessments can be programmed into native mobile apps using a webview.

m2c2kit borrows some patterns, approaches, and naming conventions from Apple's [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit) framework, but it is not a port of SpriteKit.
