# Introduction

m2c2kit is a library for creating cross-platform cognitive assessments. It is produced by the Mobile Monitoring of Cognitive Change (M2C2) research project, sponsored by the [National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/).

m2c2kit is written in Typescript and leverages Google's [canvaskit-wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvaskit-wasm) Skia-based GPU-accelerated engine to present cognitive assessments using HTML5 and JavaScript. Users can take these assessments with a mobile or desktop browser, or the assessments can be programmed into native mobile apps using a webview.
