**Important:** _Do not_ copy this entire folder and use this as a template to start a new cognitive task. Because this folder is part of the home repo of m2c2kit, this folder's build configuration files (tsconfig.json, rollup.config.js) have been modified for this purpose. **Use the m2c2kit cli to scaffold a new task.**

Dot memory is an example of a cognitive task.
