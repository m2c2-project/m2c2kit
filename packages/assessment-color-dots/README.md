This package contains the m2c2kit Color Dots assessment, which is a cued-recall, item-location memory binding task. [Live Demo](https://m2c2-project.github.io/m2c2kit/docs/examples/color-dots/)

**m2c2kit** is a library for cross-platform cognitive assessments. Features:

- **Mobile first**. Optimized for touch and mobile devices while also usable on desktops.
- **Portable**. Use on browsers, compile within native apps using web views, or embed in products like Qualtrics. A shared assessment codebase reduces development time and promotes experiment standardization across devices and services.
- **Rapid iteration**. Quickly develop and test new assessments with the JavaScript-based library and deploy them in studies.
