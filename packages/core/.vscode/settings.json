  /**
   * Setting NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules before running the test
   * was difficult. This is because the way to set environment variables
   * before running a command is different on Windows and Linux. This
   * works on windows:
   *   "jest.jestCommandLine": "set NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules&&npx jest"
   * But this would not work on Linux/MacOS.
   *
   * I tried the following:
   * 1. The below setting for "jest.nodeEnv" does not seem to apply the
   * environment variable before running jest.
   * "jest.nodeEnv": {
   *  "NODE_OPTIONS": "--experimental-vm-modules"
   * },
   *
   * 2. Using the cross-env package does not work; there is an issue with
   * backslashes (see https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/838)
   *
   * 3. The package env-cmd works. It requires a .env file to be present,
   * which is placed in the __tests__ folder.
