This package is a local database for storing m2c2kit data on the device. It uses [Dexie.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dexie), and the underlying client-side storage is IndexedDB.

**m2c2kit** is a library for cross-platform cognitive assessments. Features:

- **Mobile first**. Optimized for touch and mobile devices while also usable on desktops.
- **Portable**. Use on browsers, compile within native apps using web views, or embed in products like Qualtrics. A shared assessment codebase reduces development time and promotes experiment standardization across devices and services.
- **Rapid iteration**. Quickly develop and test new assessments with the JavaScript-based library and deploy them in studies.
